# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Overview

We've discovered an unsecured network with numbers used to encrypt crucial documents. These numbers may not always be generated with sufficiently large prime numbers. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these numbers quickly before the target fixes this encryption bug.

**Note:** This project is entirely optional, but completing any part of it will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score won't be affected if you choose not to participate. Have fun!
